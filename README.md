Wrote a program for my Empyrion server that analyzes the server database.
The program can show and filter
- all player information
- structure information
- game field information
- information about transitions between game fields
- chat log
- trading station block log
- trader log
- server load and stop log
You can use the program completely free of charge at your own risk.
It is enough to run the program and specify the path to the server database.
